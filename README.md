# mNotify
mNotify will send a SSL Post to a webhook from a command prompt

I wrote this mainly for the Notify Me Skill for the Echo Dot
I needed a way to send an SSL Post to the skills web api.
So thats what it does.

Usage: c:\mNotify (URL of API) (Message) (API Key)
Example: c:\mNotify https://api.notifymyecho.com/v1/NotifyMe?notification= "This is a tesst for the next sixty seconds" BR549123THEREISNOWayThisISaREalKey<br>
 I will be writing a Linux version as well.
